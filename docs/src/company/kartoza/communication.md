# Communication

In Kartoza, communcation is probably the most important skill that we want to engender in our staff. Whether it is communicating your work in standups and issues, talking with clients, checking in with project leads, writing emails and reports, communication is probably the most important skill needed for your work.

Good communication keeps the company running smoothly, keeps happiness levels high, instills a sense of professionalism in customers and the outside world that interact with us, and prevents wasting time and effort.

As a purely virtual company, communication skills are particularly important because we do not work together in a physical space and we need to make extra effort to ensure that we communicate well.

## Communication Systems

### Slack

Slack is our primary communication mechanism. You should have slack running and available at all times during your work day. If you run mission critical systems (e.g. maintaining client web sites, server infrastructure), you should have slack on your phone so that we can contact you after hours in emergencies.

In some cases our clients have slack channels, which you should participate and monitor as needed to carry out your client related tasks.

All staff members are at minumum members of the '1-kartoza'  and '4-random' channels. You should use 1-kartoza for **all your general communications**.

You might be tempted to use DMs (Direct Messages) to ask team mates for technical information, plan work etc. **Please don't do this!** Use the 1-kartoza channel for all communications unless it is something of a personal nature that you need to discuss with management.

Why do we ask you not to use DMs? Because when you communicate in the 1-kartoza channel that is public to the company, we realise a number of benefits:

1. We can see what things you are working on.
2. We can see you are actively working (which is often difficult in a virtual company).
3. If you are experience a technical issue, the whole company can be aware of it and potentially help you, rather than you being stuck waiting for a single person to help you.
4. If you are stuck on something, project leads and management can be aware of which projects are having issues and plan accordingly.
5. It creates a sense of 'togetherness' that is otherwise lost in a virtual company.

For internal company communications, we have our lowest bar in terms of how much attention you need to pay to grammar and crafting beautiful prose.
