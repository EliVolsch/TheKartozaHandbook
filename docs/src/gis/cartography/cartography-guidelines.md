## Common issues in cartography

No. | Image | Description
----|-------|------------------------
1 | ![Overlapping Labels](img/overlapping-labels-and-features.png) | Dont let labels overlap features.
2 | ![Road z](img/major-roads-cover-minor-roads.png) | Make sure that major roads cover minor roads.
3 | ![Scale planning](img/scale-planning.png) | Set your canvas scale to the scale you plan to print at 1Ô∏è‚É£ then lock it 2Ô∏è‚É£ then when you zoom in and out with your scroll wheel it will zoom into pixels at the fixed scale 3Ô∏è‚É£.
4 | ![Road ending](img/abruptly-ending-roads.png) | Don't include roads on your map that end abruptly unless this indeed reflects reality.
5 | ![Road caps](img/road-cap-style.png) | Generally you should use a round cap style for your roads to avoid issues of the road cap extending beyond intersecting roads.
6 | ![Points on top](img/points-on-top.png) | As a general rule, points should be drawn above polygon and line features.
7 | ![Font Language](img/font-matches-language.png) | Use a font that matches the language of your map.
8 | ![Symbol Layer](img/solid-symbol-layer-background.png) | Use symbol layers to place a solid background behind symbols which are transparent and are getting lost in the background.
9 | ![Inappropriate Transparency](img/inappropriate-transparency.png) | Do not use transparency inappropriately. Features like dams should be usually rendered with a solid fill.
10 | ![Avoid Clutter](img/avoid-visual-clutter.png) | Avoid visual clutter in your map. If there are too many features visible with similar contrast  your user will quickly become overwhelmed.
