# Polyglot: The Emoji Map

Although it may have a steep initial learning curve or implementation strategy, using emoji and unicode symbols to tag elements is a fun and intuitive way to attach metadata to elements which makes visually scanning over documents and commit histories much more effective in multiple languages.

In order for this to be effective, a consistent method of referencing the emoji meanings is required. This is challenging because the utilisation of emoji are typically context specific, which requires a mapping of emoji meanings for various contexts.

## GitMoji

Tagging commit messages in git is a useful tool for visually assessing the issues addressed by a particular commit.

A community standard has already been developed, available at [https://gitmoji.dev/](https://gitmoji.dev/)

## GeoMoji

As with GitMoji, we need a consistent way to reference Geographic Information Elements. This could be related data sources, licenses, tools, or . Some may [confuse the concept of geomoji with generic symbology and signage](https://eos.org/geofizz/geomojis-translate-geoscience-across-any-language), but in this instance the reference is to a series of common Emoji characters which can be used as concise, visually effective hashtags across applications, search tools, git messages, documentation, or social media. It would be great to extend this concept to a collection of map symbols (e.g. using emoji instead of a font library).

A alpha-state concept project is in development at [https://github.com/zacharlie/geomoji](https://github.com/zacharlie/geomoji).
